0, using BLAT output *.psl and telomeric reads to determine potential telomere addition sites (>=5 reads pileup).
1, Determine legal telomere addition site. (Solve some problems like telomere in the middle, or two 5â€™ telomere addition sites have same number of reads pileup).
2, output capped sequences
